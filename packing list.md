# Weekend Packing List
This is a packing list for taking a two night trip to a large American city. It is my own list that I use, so its is obviously idiosyncratic. Please remix and adapt it to suit your own needs.

The list aims for "slightly more than necessary", but only by one or two above the perceived minimum (one complete outfit a day).

For example, though the trip only spans across three days, there are a total of five pairs of socks, allowing for the possibility of changing your socks halfway through a day.

It's compassionate minimalism - planning for the travel-tired future you.
