## Flow of Work
### Preheat
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
### Do prep (above)
Measure out all ingredients, and do prepwork to ingredients in bold.
### Béchamel:
Put the milk in a small sauce-pot and heat on low (just to get warmed up).
Melt the butter over low heat in a small saucepan and add the flour all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon for 2 minutes. 

Slowly pour the hot milk into the butter–flour mixture and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is thickened. Remove from heat. Add the salt, pepper, nutmeg, 1/2 cup grated Gruyere, and the Parmesan, stir until even, and then set aside.
### Toast:
Place the slices on 2 baking sheets and bake for 5 minutes. Turn each slice and bake for another 2 minutes, until toasted.

Spread half the toasted breads with mustard, add a slice of ham to each, and **sprinkle with half the remaining Gruyere.**

Top with another piece of toasted bread. Slather the tops with the cheese sauce, sprinkle with the remaining Gruyere, and bake the sandwiches for 5 minutes. 

Leave the sandwiches in the oven. Turn on the broiler (change mode, raise temperature) and broil for 5 minutes, or until the topping is bubbly and lightly browned. Serve hot.
